            <p>Yes, she happens to be more experienced than a normal girl, but sometimes love should be&hellip; terrifying. Talk you off what, Pop Pop? Monday morning. COME ON! If I make this comeback, I&rsquo;ll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! Those are balls. Ohhh little guy. The tears aren&rsquo;t coming. The tears just aren&rsquo;t coming. These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. </p>
<p>Let me take off my assistant&rsquo;s skirt and put on my Barbra-Streisand-in-The-Prince-of-Tides ass-masking therapist pantsuit. Although George Michael had only got to second base, he&rsquo;d gone in head first, like Pete Rose. Let me give that oatmeal some brown sugar. No! These are just strippers! Look how hot they are! Stop licking my hand, you horse&rsquo;s ass! This is the best free scrapbooking class I&rsquo;ve ever taken! </p>
<p>Bob Loblaw Lobs Law Bomb. But I&rsquo;m the oldest. The matriarch if you will. See for more good stuff. I don&rsquo;t criticize you! And if you&rsquo;re worried about criticism, sometimes a diet is the best defense. Can&rsquo;t a guy call his mother pretty without it seeming strange? Amen. And how about that little piece of tail on her? Cute! You stay on top of her, Buddy. Don&rsquo;t be afraid to ride her. Hard. Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere in the OC? I hear the jury&rsquo;s still out on science. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t want no part of yo&rsquo; tight-ass country club, ya freak bitch! I just dont want him to point out my cracker ass in front of Ann. Buster&rsquo;s in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman&rsquo;s terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he&rsquo;s actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. One of the guys told me to take my head out of my BOTTOM and get back to work&hellip;my BOTTOM! Hahahaha. Either I zip down, or he zips up, and that is a mighty long zipper on Mother&rsquo;s Cher jumpsuit. It&rsquo;s a wonderful restaurant! </p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a new daddy in town. A discipline daddy. I never thought I&rsquo;d miss a hand so much! </p>
<p>She&rsquo;s a girl, I need to teach her how to be a woman. Within her lies a queen. Let me out that queen. Fun and failure both start out the same way. I hear the jury&rsquo;s still out on science. </p>
<p>No borders, no limits&hellip; go ahead, touch the Cornballer&hellip; you know best? Did you know that more frozen bananas are sold right here on this boardwalk than anywhere on the OC? I&rsquo;ll buy you a hundred George Michaels that you can teach to drive! You can always tell a Milford man. It walked on my pillow! </p>
<p>I see you&rsquo;ve wasted no time in filling my seat hole. It&rsquo;s as Ann as the nose on plain&rsquo;s face. I was once called the worst audience participant Cirque du Soleil ever had. Gosh Mom&hellip; after all these years, God&rsquo;s not going to take a call from you. We need a name. Maybe &lsquo;Operation Hot Mother&rsquo;. What, so the guy we are meeting with can&rsquo;t even grow his own hair? COME ON! Tobias Fünke costume. I&rsquo;ve always been deeply passionate about nature. Perhaps you remember Neuterfest? <em>M:</em> I&rsquo;ll never forget your wedding. </p>
<p>We&rsquo;ll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. A lady of the evening. Working girl. She turns illusions for money. When a.. man.. needs to prove to a woman that he&rsquo;s actually.. [pause].. When a man loves a woman.. Quicken! Premiere! I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m with Michael on this one. The guy runs a prison, he can have any piece of ass he wants. We&rsquo;ll have to find something to do so that people can look at you without wanting to kill themselves. I&rsquo;m gonna build me an airport, put my name on it. Why, Michael? So you can fly away from your feelings? </p>
<p>I [bleeped] the business model. Yeah, she had all kinds of orgasms. So did you see the new Poof? His name&rsquo;s Gary, and we don&rsquo;t need anymore lawsuits. Yeah, like anyone would want to R her. Yo quiero leche. Yo quiero leche de madre. Buster&rsquo;s in what we like to call a light to no coma. In layman&rsquo;s terms, it might be considered a very heavy nap.</p>
